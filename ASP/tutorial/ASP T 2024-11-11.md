# 1. Shocks in the viscous Burgers Equation
> Let us consider the ASEP on a lattice with $L$ sites. The mean occupation $\rho_i=\braket{n_i}$ follows the evolution equation $(1.1)$. We want to take the continuum limit of this process in the weakly asymmetric limit, where $p=0.5+\alpha/L$ with $\alpha>0$. To do so, we use $\braket{n_in_{i+1}} \approx \braket{n_i}\braket{n_{i+1}}$ and we introduce a continuous function $\phi$, such that $\phi(x=i/L, t)=\rho_i(t)$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \pdv{\braket{n_i}}{t}
        &=&
            p\braket{n_{i-1}(1-n_i)}
            + (1-p)\braket{n_{i+1}(1-n_i)} \\
        &&
            - p\braket{n_i(1-n_{i+1})}
            - (1-p)\braket{n_i(1-n_{i-1})} \hspace{3cm} (1.1)
\end{eqnarray}
$$

## 1.a
> By plugging this expression into $(1.1)$, performing a series expansion to second order in $L^{-1}$, and rescaling time via $t^\prime=t/L^2$, show that this leads to the following equation $(1.2)$  in the properly chosen moving frame, and give the value of $\lambda$ and $\nu$. This equation, the tone-dimensional Burgers equation, was originally introduced as a model for fluid turbulence. In the following the rescaled time variable $t^\prime$ will be denoted by $t$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \pdv{\phi}{t^\prime} + \lambda \pdv{\phi}{x} &=& \nu\pdv[2]{\phi}{x} \hspace{5cm} (1.2)
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Proof:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    p &=& \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\alpha}{L} \\
\\
        &=& L^2 \pdv{\braket{n_i}}{t} \\
        &=& L^2 \pdv{\rho_i}{t} \\
    \pdv{\phi}{t^\prime} &=& \dv{t}{t^\prime} \cdot \pdv{\phi}{t}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

# 2. Exclusion process with long-range jumps
 > We consider a variant of the totally asymmetric exclusion process on the ring, where particles can perform long-range jumps. Specifically, particles jump as far as they can without overtaking the particle in front of it: if the particle has a cluster of $k\ge1$ vacant sites in front of it, it jumps a distance $k$ to the right (see Fig. 1). We consider such a system on a lattice of size $L$ with $N$ particles, where $2\le N\le L$ (with periodic boundary conditions). The density is defined as $\rho=N/L$. This process can be simulated as follows: at each time step, choose a particle and attempt to move it. $N$ such attempts constitute $1$ unit of time.

## 2.a balance equation
> Can a new cluster of particles or holes form in this process? Can the number of clusters decrease? Use this to find the steady state of the process, and show that the associated probability distribution fulfills the global balance equation $(2.1)$, for all configurations $C$. You can also use numerical simulations to get an idea of what the steady state is.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \sum_{C^\prime} P(C^\prime)\Gamma(C^\prime\rightarrow C)
        - \sum_{C^\prime} P(C)\Gamma(C\rightarrow C^\prime)
        &=& 0 \hspace{2cm} (2.1)
\end{eqnarray}
$$

The number of clusters cannot increase, since each particle jumps as far as possible each time, but it can decrease, since clusters can merge. Hence, the stationary state consists of a single cluster with $N$ particles. Since always the leading particle jumps to the end, the cluster itself moves backwards.

Thus, for all stationary states $C$ there is each one possibility to get into the state $(C^\prime\rightarrow C)$ and one to leave the state $(C\rightarrow C^\prime)$. The probability for each state is constant at $P(C)=L^{-1}$, while the jump rate $\Gamma$ is proportional to a delta function matching a single possible configuration $C^\prime$ in each sum.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    0 &=& \sum_{C^\prime} P(C^\prime)\Gamma(C^\prime\rightarrow C)
          -\sum_{C^\prime} P(C)\Gamma(C\rightarrow C^\prime) \\
      &=& \frac{1}{L} - \frac{1}{L} \\
      && \qquad\square
\end{eqnarray}
$$

## 2.b stationary current
> We define the current in the system in the steady state as $J=\rho v$, where $v$ is the mean number of sites traveled by one particle per unit time. Show that the current-density relationship is given by $J=1-\rho$.
> Show that the same result follows if you assume that all ${L \choose N}$ configurations are equally probable. *Hint*: In this case, one needs to calculate the likelihood that for any particle, the next $k$ sites are unoccupied and the $(k+1)$-th site is occupied, and then perform the appropriate sum over $k$. You can assume that the system is large, such that sites are occupied independently with probability $\rho$ (Bernoulli measure).

If a jump happens, the jump has a length of $\ell = L-N$. Since $N$ random positions are selected per unit of time, hence the probability to find the single movable particle is $1/N$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    v &=& \braket{\ell} \frac{\ell}{N} \\
        &=& \frac{L-N}{N} \\
        &=& \rho^{-1} - 1 \\
    \Rightarrow J &=& \rho \cdot v \\
        &=& \rho (\rho^{-1} - 1) \\
        &=& 1 - \rho \\
        && \qquad \square
\end{eqnarray}
$$

This is also valid if all configurations are equally likely.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    v &=& \braket{\ell} \\
        &=& \sum_{k=1}^{L-N} \rho(1-\rho)^k k \\
        &=& \sum_{k=1}^{L-N} (1-\rho)^k k \\
        &=& \rho \sum_{k=1}^{L-N} (1-\rho)^k k \\
        &=& \rho \frac{1-\rho}{\rho^2} \\
        &=& \rho^{-1} - 1 \\
    \Rightarrow J &=& \rho v \\
        &=& 1 - \rho \\
        && \qquad \qquad \square
\end{eqnarray}
$$

## 2.c Bonus
> To check the above result, perform a computer simulation of the system with $\rho=1/4$, and system size $L=400$. Initialize the system by assigning each particle to a randomly chosen empty site. Verify that the average current is given by $(2.2)$. Compute the average size of a cluster $\braket{L_c(t)}$ and shows that it grows approximately as $\sqrt{t}$ before saturating (at which value?).
