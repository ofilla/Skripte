# 2. Interfaces and Gaussian fluctuations
> In the lectures, you have seen that the fluctuations of interfaces are associated with broken spatial translation invariance. This explains why those fluctuations are described by a GL functional very similar to the angular mode of the XY model.
> When a symmetry is explicitly broken, the mode acquires a finite correlation length. This is the case for the angular mode of the XY model $\theta$ in the presence of a magnetic field.
> We now explore this in the context of capillary waves of a fluid interface, for example, between a liquid and its vapour.

## a) free energy
> Argue that in the presence of gravity, which breaks the translational symmetry along the $z$-axis, the capillary wave free energy of the interface derived in the lectures takes the form $(2.1)$ and determine the coefficient $\alpha$ in terms of the gravitational acceleration $g$ and the mass density difference $\Delta \rho$ of the two phases.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \qq*{(2.1):}\qquad\qquad
    \mathcal F[h]
        &=&
            \int
                \frac{1}{2} \gamma (\nabla h)^2
                + \frac{1}{2} \alpha h^2
            \dd[2]{\vec x}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

### surface tension
One contribution is created by the surface tension with the free energy $\mathcal F_s$.

The infinitesimal area $\dd{A}$ can be calculated by Pythagoras' theorem for infinitesimal lengths.[^1] Since $\dd{A}$ is so small, a [[20230303210116|Taylor expansion]] can be applied.

From this, the free energy $\mathcal F_s$ can be computed.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mathcal F_s
        &=& \gamma A \\
    \dd{A}
        &=& \sqrt{1+(\nabla h)^2} \\
        &\approx& 1 + \frac{1}{2}(\nabla h) \\
    \Rightarrow
    A
        &\approx&
            \int
                1
                + \frac{1}{2}(\nabla h)
            \dd[2]{\vec x} \\
    \Rightarrow
    \mathcal F_s
        &\approx& \gamma
            \int
                1
                + \frac{1}{2}(\nabla h)
            \dd[2]{\vec x} \\
        &=& \gamma L^2  + \int \frac{1}{2} \gamma (\nabla h)^2 \dd[2]{\vec x}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

### pinning potential
In this model, the pinning potential $V_p(h)$ is caused by gravitation, with the force $F_G=mg$. This leads to the potential $V_p(h)=mgh$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    V_p(h) &=& m(h)\cdot gh \\
    m(h)
        &=&
            \int
                \rho(\vec x) h
            \dd[2]{\vec x}
            \\
        &\vdots&
            \\
        &=&
            \frac{1}{2}\Delta\rho h^2 + \mathrm{const}
            \\
    \Rightarrow
    \mathcal F_G
        &=&
            \int
                \frac{1}{2}
                \Delta\rho g h^2
            \dd[2]{\vec x}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

The free energy $\mathcal F_G$ provided from this potential is derived via integration.

### free energy
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mathcal F
        &=&
            \mathcal F_s + \mathcal F_G \\
        &=&
            \gamma L^2
            + \int
                \frac{1}{2} \gamma (\nabla h)^2
                + \frac{1}{2} \alpha h^2
            \dd[2]{\vec x} \\
    \alpha
        &=&
            \Delta\rho g
\end{eqnarray}
