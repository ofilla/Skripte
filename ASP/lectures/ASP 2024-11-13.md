### Ising model
The Ising model is a classical model to describe [[20231030093100|magnetism]]. It uses a lattice with classical spins on all positions.

The energy[^1] $H$ of a [[20230228174954|microstate]] can be described with the *(exchange) coupling* $J$ and the external *magnetic field* $h$. The coupling is only relevant for nearest neighbours $\braket{i,j}$. For $J>0$, [[20230828121438|ferromagnetism]] occurs, for $J<0$ [[20231111130423|antiferromagnism]].

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    H &=& -J \sum_{\braket{i,j}} \sigma_i\sigma_j - h\sum_i \sigma_i
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Without external field $h=0$, the energy $H$ is invariant of flipping a spin $\sigma_i\mapsto-\sigma_i$. This *symmetry* is spontaneously broken at low [[20230403104255|temperatures]] $T$ in ferromagnetism.

The [[20230901205708|intensive thermodynamic variable]] is the [[20231030091047|magnetization]] $m=\braket{\sigma_i}_{h,T}$ dependent on the [[20230901205542|extensive variables]] $h, T$. Below the [[20231030093402|Curie temperature]] $T_C$, first order [[20231111163639|phase transitions]] between $m>0$ and $m<0$ occur constantly. Both phases of $m(T)$ coexist. Above $T_C$, this discontinuity vanishes and [[20230828095949|paramagnetism]] occurs.

#### mapping to a lattice gas
This is analogous to the liquid-gas transition, apart from the symmetry. In this case, the external field $h$ is analogue to the [[20230829113605|pressure]] $P$, the magnetisation $m$ to the velocity $v$. In both cases, the density $\rho=v^{-1}$ is described the same.

The occupation numbers can be denoted as $\eta_i=\frac{1}{2}(1+\sigma_i)=\pm 1$. For [[20230828121438|ferromagnetism]], the interaction between particles is attractive $(J>0)$. Thus, the density is $\rho=\braket{\eta_i}=\frac{1}{2}(1+m)$. For $m>0$, the state is similar to a liquid, for $m<0$ it is similar to a gas.

Then, the energy $H$ can be written with the *coupling* $J$, external *magnetic field* $h$ and the [[20241010090855|particle number]] $N$. Further, the *number of broken bonds* $A$ describes the bonds on the lattice, that connect sites with different [[20230814144242|spins]] $\sigma_i$ or $\eta_i$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    H &=& 2JA - 2hN + \mathrm{const}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

$N$ describes the volume of a "droplet", a [[20231111130821|domain]], and $A$ the surface of the same droplet.[^2] $2J$ is analogue to the *interface energy*, $2h$ to the [[20230729145443|chemical potential]].

[^2]: In 2 dimensions, $N$ is the area and $A$ the length of the contour.

#### mapping to binary alloys
An *alloy* (Legierung) is a *metal* consisting of two species of atoms $A$ and $B$. These can be mapped to the spin, e.g. $A\mapsto\sigma_i=1$ and $B\mapsto\sigma_i=-1$.

With positive *coupling* $J>0$, both species are *segregated*, with big [[20231111130821|domain]]-like "drops" of the same metal. This is comparable to the [[20230828121438|ferromagnetic]] phase. With negative coupling $J<0$, it is analogue to [[20231111130423|antiferromagnism]], where next neighbours want to be different species of atoms.

On e.g. a triangular lattice, some positions have *frustration*, because these particles are both next to a spin up and down. In this case, the [[20230812104044|ground state]] is exponentially degenerate.

#### related models
##### Schelling model for social segregation
A similar model is used to describe social *segregation*, done by Schelling in 1971.

##### neural systems
Also, neural systems can be described similarly.

##### Patts model
Extends the *Ising model* for $q$ states $\sigma_i=0,\dots,(q-1)$, instead of $2$ spins. With positive *coupling* $J>0$, there are $q$ degenerate [[20230812104044|ground states]].

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    H &=& -J \sum_{\braket{i,j}} \sigma_i\sigma_j
\end{eqnarray}
$$

##### Heisenberg model
The Heisenberg model extends the *Ising model* using a 3-dimensional vector with continuous components, [[20241014140623|normalized]] as $|\vec\sigma_i|=1$. It describes a continuous rotational system.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    H &=& -J \sum_{\braket{i,j}} \vec\sigma_i\vec\sigma_j
\end{eqnarray}
$$

##### n-vector model
The $n$-vector model generlizes the *Ising model*.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    H &=& -J \sum_{\braket{i,j}} \sum_{\alpha=1}^n \sigma_i^\alpha\sigma_j^\alpha \\
    \sum_\alpha (\sigma_i^\alpha)^2 &=& 1
\end{eqnarray}
$$

With $n=3$, it is the Ising model, with $n=2$ the *Heisenberg model*. With $n=2$ it is a $XY$-model.

##### Spin glass
Spin glasses are disordered or diluted magnets. Opposed to e.g. a [[20230828121438|Ferromagnet]], only some sites on a [[20230730120424|lattice]] have a magnetic [[20230829114215|degree of freedom]].

##### Edwards-Anderson model
The Edwards-Anderson model can describe *Spin glasses*. It is similar to the *Ising model*, but the *coupling* $J_{ij}$ depends on the positions. I.e., the coupling is a [[20221028195435|random variable]] with vanishing [[20221028194709|expected value]] $\braket{J_{ij}}=0$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    H &=& - \sum_{\braket{i,j}} J_{ij} \sigma_i\sigma_j \\
    \braket{J_{ij}} &=& 0
\end{eqnarray}
$$

With $\braket{J_{ij}^2}>0$, particles can suffer *frustration*. Calculating thermodynamic properties as averages with respect to $J_{ij}$ is difficult. The *replica trick* can be useful.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \braket{F}_{J_{ij}}
        &=& -k_BT\braket{\ln Z}_{ij} \\
        &\neq& -k_BT\ln\braket{Z}_{ij} \qquad\text{at low }T
\end{eqnarray}
$$

##### replica trick
The replica trick describes the logarithm the *partition function* $Z$ as a limit of the partition function with $n$ replicas.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \ln Z &=& \lim_{n\rightarrow 0} \frac{Z^n-1}{n}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
