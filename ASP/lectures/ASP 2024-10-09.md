Assume a box with $N$ particles.

A [[20230228174954|microstate]] is the description of a state in all its details. In [[20241010090350|classical mechanics]], it's described by position vectors ${\vec r_i}$ and [[20230828155847|impulses]] ${\vec p_i}$ with $6N$ components. In [[20230408112055|quantum mechanics]], it's described by a [[20241010091103|wave function]] $\Psi(\vec r_i)$.

If we let this system alone, i.e. without applying external forces, for a long time $t\rightarrow\infty$, it gets into a [[20230228175311|macrostate]] in [[20230301091751|thermal equilibrium]]. In this case, a small number of macroscopic variables can describe the system. In mechanical systems, the [[20241010090855|particle number]] $N$, the [[20241010092336|volume]] $V$ and the total energy $E$ are used. $E$ is known from [[20230825125242|mechanics]]. From [[20241010092719|Noether's theorem]], we know that energy conservation is related to [[20241010094112|time invariance]]. Since the box is limited, neither [[20241010094135|translation invariance]] nor [[20241010094158|rotational invariance]] are given, such [[20230828155847|momentum]] and [[20230814141041|angular momentum]] are not conserved.

A thermodynamic description exists for $N\rightarrow\infty$ in terms of deterministic relations between a small number of macroscopic variables characterising the equilibrium state.

The [[20221020201709|statistical physics]] wants to explain how the macroscopic description emerges from the microscopic information, what properties (information) survive on the macroscopic level and how fluctuations in macroscopic quantities disappear on large systems with $N\rightarrow\infty$. If a small system can interact with a lager system, these fluctuations can be described by [[20241010122324|Stochastic Thermodynamics]]. Further, thermodynamic description of Nonequilibrium Systems are researched in [[20241010121732|Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics]] (NESM).

### $1.1$ Entropy
The [[20230829190239|Entropy]] $S(E,V,N)$ is an extensive function of [[20230901205542|extensive state variables]]. [[20230301091751|Equilibrium states]] are states of maximal entropy $S$, where [[20230901205708|intensive variables]] are equal.

An example of maximizing entropy is the [[20241010123656|equilibration of systems in contact]].

#### Conditions for Stability of the Equilibrium State
If the [[20230829190239|entropy]] $S$ is maximal at [[20230301091751|equilibrium]], it must be a [[20241010130229|convex function]].

Thus, the [[20241010131312|heat capacity]] for constant volume $C_V$ is positive: Radiating energy decreases temperature. Similarly, the [[20241011110411|compressibility]] $\kappa_T$ is positive: Compression increases pressure.

This is necessary for stable cases. E.g. stars contradict this, but are not stable.

If these conditions seem to be not true in a theory, it may hint towards phase transitions.

$$
\begin{align}
    C_x &= T\left(\frac{\partial S^2}{\partial T^2}\right)_{x,N}
        & > 0 \\
    \kappa_T
        &= -\frac{1}{V} \left(\frac{\partial S^2}{\partial P^2}\right)_{T,N}
        &> 0 \\
    \left(\frac{\partial S^2}{\partial V^2}\right)_{T,N}
        &= - \frac{1}{TV\kappa_T}
        &< 0
\end{align}
$$

#### [[20230403100902|Boltzmann's entropy]]
Entropy is a measure for degeneracy (loss of information) of the microscopic description. $S$ is proportional to the [[20230402162515|microcanonical partition function]] $\Omega(E,V,N)$, describing the number of microstates compatible with $E,V,N$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    S &=& S(E,V,N) \\
        &=& k_B \ln(\Omega(E,V,N))
\end{eqnarray}
$$
