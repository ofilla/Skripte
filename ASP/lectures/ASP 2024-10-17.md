#### [[20250218123234|hydrodynamic limit]]
For a [[20221026123304|random walk]], a first continuum can be reached in the hydrodynamic limit.

The hydrodynamic limit supposes the steps of a [[20221026123304|random walk]] are taken at a rate $\Gamma$ with a microscopic step size $\ell\rightarrow 0$. Hereby, the number of steps $n=\Gamma t$ is described by time $t$, while $\Gamma \ell^2\equiv 2D$ must be a finite [[20250218123558|diffusion constant]].

#### [[20250218123558|diffusion constant]]
This leads to the diffusion constant $D$, in the unit $\frac{\mathrm{length}^2}{\mathrm{time}}$. This leads to a [[20241016101000|Probability of simple Random Walks]] $P$ as follows.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    P(\vec R(t))
        &=& \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi Dt}}\right)^d
            \exp\left[-\frac{R^2}{4Dt}\right]
\end{eqnarray}
$$

This solves the [[20250218124416|2nd diffusion equation]], with the initial condition of the particle starting in a certain position $\vec R$, described by the [[20230303204120|delta function]] $\delta(\vec R)$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} &=& D\nabla^2P \\
    \left.P(\vec R)\right|_{t=0} &=& \delta(\vec R)
\end{eqnarray}
$$

#### [[20250218131413|Brownian motion]]
Brownian motion, or the Wiener process describes a [[20221026123304|random walk]] with $n\rightarrow \infty$ in a continuous limit.

The idea is to "squish together" a random walk into a unit time, rendering it continuous. This process is called [[20250218131614|Brownian scaling]]. The result is nowhere smooth or differentiable, but it is [[20250218131543|scale invariant]].

##### [[20250218131614|Brownian scaling]]
The positions $X_i$ of a [[20221026123304|random walk]] are connected with a continuous line, rendering it $\{\tilde X_s\}_{0\le s\le n}$, for a constant $n$. This is converted to $\{B^{(n)}_t\}_{0\le t\le1}$.

While $s$ denotes the distance between the points, $t$ denotes the time required for $n$ steps. In the limit $n\rightarrow\infty$, it becomes the [[20250218131413|Brownian motion]] $B_t$: Infinitely many steps in a given time yield a continuous process.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    B^{(n)}_t &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \tilde X_{t\cdot n} \\
    t &=& \frac{s}{n} \\
    \braket{B^{(n)}_t} &=& 0 \\
    \Rightarrow \braket{(\Delta B^{(n)}_t)^2} &=& t \\
    B_t &=& \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} B^{(n)}_t
\end{eqnarray}
$$

##### scale invariance
Scale invariance describes an object that looks the same regardless of scale. E.g. the [[20250218131902|Mandelbrot set]] looks the same, regardless on how far is zoomed in.

### 2.2 other universality classes
Under which conditions does the [[20230223130500|central limit theorem]] fail?

##### 2.2.1 [[20250218142009|Levy flights]]
Consider a [[20221026123304|random walk]] with steps $\vec \ell_i$ and $\braket{\vec \ell_i}=0$ and diverging [[20221028194035|variance]] $\braket{(\Delta \ell)^2}=\infty$. One example is the [[20250218142029|Cauchy distribution]] $p(\ell)$.

#### [[20250218142029|Cauchy distribution]]
The [[20221028194709|expected value]] is $\braket{\ell}=0$, but the [[20221028194035|variance]] $\braket{(\Delta \ell)^2}=\infty$ diverges. Thus, single $\ell$ are very much larger than most other and dominate the sum of many steps. In this case, the [[20230223130500|central limit theorem]] fails.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    P(\ell) &=& \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{1}{1+\ell^2} \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$

For large $\ell$, the tail of the probability $P(\ell\gg 1)$ can be approximated by an exponential function, with a  parameter $\mu$. The number of steps larger than a given distance $x$ can be calculated by integration over the tail of the curve.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    P(\ell\gg 1) &=& \ell^{-(\mu+1)} \\
    P(\ell>x) &=& \int_x^\infty \ell^{-(\mu+1)} \dd{\ell} \\
        &\propto& x^{-\mu}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

#### [[20250218142402|extreme value statistics]]
Extreme value statistics considers the most extreme values, e.g. asks for the largest value.

For example, the [[20230901133141|average]] of the largest step size $\ell_\mathrm{max}$ could be estimated for the [[20250218142029|Cauchy distribution]]. The number of steps $N$ larger than $x$ can be described as follows. Assuming only a single step was larger than $\hat x$, this distance can be estimated by setting $N=1$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    N &\propto& n x^{-\mu} \\
    1 &\propto& n \hat x^{-\mu} \\
    \Leftrightarrow \hat x &\propto& \sqrt[\mu]{n} \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$

#### 2.2.2 [[20250218142621|self-avoiding random walk]]
A self-avoiding random walk is a [[20221026123304|random walk]] that does not allow returns to an already used position. If the random walk would visit a formerly visited position, it stops instead. Thus, it can trap itself.

It can be compared to a game of snake (possibly in higher dimensions), but while hitting random keys.

For up to $3$ dimensions, such a walker will be stuck on the long term. For at least $5$ dimensions, such a random walk will not re-visit positions.

##### [[20250218152547|Fleury's argument]]
The chemist Fleury analysed the [[20250218142621|self-avoiding random walk]] for less than $3$ dimension, using [[20230825125343|thermodynamics]].

Re-visiting a position is theoretically allowed, but it costs energy. Then, the [[20250218152250|free energy]] $F$ of a polymer with $n$ links, given the end-to-end distance $R(n)$ at [[20230301091751|thermal equilibrium]].

Assume $N_\mathrm{int}$ intersections are used and each requires an energy $U$. The [[20230829190239|entropy]] $S$ is described by the number $\Omega$ of random walks with $n$ steps and distance $R$.

Here, $\Omega_0$ describes the number of random walks in $d$ dimensions with $n$ steps. $c$ is a constant. 

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    F &=& E - TS \\
    E &=& N_\mathrm{int} \cdot U \\
        &\propto& \frac{n^2}{R^d} U \\
    S &=& k \ln \Omega \\
    \Omega &\propto& \Omega_0\exp[-\frac{R^2}{2n\ell^2}] \\
    \Rightarrow S &=& k\ln \Omega_0 - \frac{kR^2}{2n\ell^2} \\
    \Rightarrow F
        &\approx& \frac{n^2}{R^d} U
            - T S_0
            + c \frac{TR^2}{n} \\
        &=& F_0
            + \frac{n^2}{R^d} U
            + c \frac{TR^2}{n}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

For small distances $R$, the free energy $F(R)$ gets very large. Now, the optimal distance $R^*$ can be calculated. This yields to the [[20250218152519|Fleury exponent]] $\nu_f$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial R} &=& 0 \\
    \Rightarrow R^* &=& \left(\frac{n^3U}{2cT}\right)^{1/(d+2)} \\
        &\approx& n^{\nu_f} \\
    \nu_f &=& \frac{3}{d+2}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
