The droplet is shrinking with a speed $\dot R=v_n = -2/R$. In $d>1$ dimensions, the shrinking speed is as follows.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \dot R &=& - \frac{d-1}{R}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

The generalisation to arbitrary interface configurations was done by Allan and Cahn, leading to the *Allen-Cahn equation*. It has a normal velocity $v_n=-K$, dependent on the curvature $K$. For a $d$-dimensional sphere, the curvature $K_d$ emerges.

Thus, the droplet disappears at a time $t=t_0\propto R^2$. Thus, the lifetime is proportional to $R^2$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    K &=& \sum_{i=1}{d-1} \frac{1}{R_i} \\
    K_{d} &=& \frac{d-1}{R} \\
    R(t) &=& \sqrt{R^2(0) - 2(d-1)t} \\
    t_0 &=& \frac{R^2(0)}{2(d-1)}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
#### coarsening law
The typical curvature at a time $t$ is $1/L(t)$. This leads to the coarsening law, which looks like *diffusion*, but is different.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    v_n &\propto& \frac{1}{L} \\
        &\propto& \dot L \\
    \Rightarrow
    L(t) &\propto& \sqrt{t}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
### 5.3 d) conserved dynamics
Because a single droplet cannot shrink, two droplets are to be considered. The two phases can be interpreted as two species of particles. The droplets are of phase $A$, while everything else is in phase $B$. The two droplets have radii $R_i$ and a distance $R_{12}$.

The total interface free energy $F_s$ is described as before. Additionally, the total [[20241010092336|volume]] $V$ of the $A$-phase is required to be constant.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    F_s &=& 4\pi\gamma(R_1^2+R_2^2) \\
    V &=& \frac{4\pi}{3}(R_1^3+R_2^3)
\end{eqnarray}
$$

The free energy $F_s$ for fixed $V$ is maximal for $R_1=R_2$ and minimal for only a single droplet. In order to minimise the free energy, the smaller droplets shrinks and vanishes, while the other one grows accordingly.

This involves transport of $A$-phase, driven by a difference in [[20230729145443|chemical potential]] $\mu_i$. The chemical potential of a droplet describes the change of free energy, if a particle is added. Thus, it depends on the *atomic volume* $\Omega$.

The *gradient* $\nabla \mu$ describes the force that drives the particles of phase $A$ from the small droplet to the large one. The speed $v=\sigma\nabla\mu$ is described by the *mobility*, which is described by the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the *Einstein relation*.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mu &\propto& \Omega \dv{F_s}{V} \\
        &=& \Omega \frac{2\gamma}{R} \\
    \nabla \mu &=& \frac{\mu_2-\mu_1}{R_{12}} \\
        &=& 2\gamma\Omega \frac{1}{R_{12}}
            \left(
                \frac{1}{R_2} - \frac{1}{R_1}
            \right) \\
    \sigma &=& \frac{D}{k_BT}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

The *scaling hypothesis* tells that all length scales are of the same order $L\approx R_1, R_2, R_{12}$, describing both droplets and their distance. Thus, the speed is of the order $v\propto L^{-2}$ and the lifetime of the droplet is as follows.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    v
        &\propto&
            \frac{1}{L^2} \\
    t
        &=&
            \frac{L}{v} \\
        &\propto& L^3 \\
    \Rightarrow
    L &\propto& \sqrt[3]{t}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Thus, the *coarsening law* scales slower than in the conserved case. This is true for any dimension $d>1$. It is intuitive that the transport slows the process, i.e. that transporting particles is slower than just flipping something locally.

With the formulas from above, this can be shown: In the Fourier room, the additional $\nabla^2$ in the conserved case slows the process.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \qq*{non-conserved: } \pdv{\Phi}{t}
        &=& \nabla^2\Phi - f^\prime \\
    \qq*{conserved: } \pdv{\Phi}{t}
        &=& -\nabla^2(\nabla^2\Phi - f^\prime) \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$

### 5.3 e) coarsening laws in one dimension
In one dimension, the *Ginzburg-Landau theory* and the *Ising model* behave differently at zero [[20230403104255|temperature]] $t=0$. For sake of simplicity, we use the *non-conserved* dynamics.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\pdv{\Phi}{t}
        &=& \pdv[2]{x}\Phi - f^\prime \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$

In the $1d$ Ising model, the energy cost of a domain is independent of its size. Thus, no interface free energy exists. However, this is not quite true for the free energy $F_s$ in the GL-equation.

#### i. Ginzburg-Landau equation
Assume a domain of size $R$. Similar to the case in three dimensions, there is a small attractive interaction $F_s(\infty)-F_s(R)$ exists and depends on the *correlation length* $\xi$. This leads to a force $f$, a lifetime $t$ and a time-dependent length $L(t)$

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    F_s(\infty)-F_s(R)
        &\propto&
            \exp\left[-\frac{R}{\xi}\right] \\
    \Rightarrow
    t &\propto&
            \exp\left[\frac{R}{\xi}\right] \\
    \Rightarrow
    L(t) &\propto& \ln t
\end{eqnarray}
$$

#### ii. Ising chain with non-conserved dynamics
To have an ordered phase, the [[20230403104255|temperature]] needs to be $T=0$. The non-conserved spin-flip dynamics

If a spin pointing in the "wrong" direction is flipped, the energy $\Delta H=-2J$ is gained. Assume this transition to be from state $\mathcal C$ to $\mathcal C^\prime$, then the *detailed balance* describes the dependency of this energy and the temperature.

At zero temperature $T=0$, the spin-flip dynamics is *irreversible*, because transitions increasing the energy $H$ cannot occur.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{\Gamma(\mathcal C^\prime\rightarrow\mathcal C)}{\Gamma(\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathcal C^\prime)}
        &=& \exp[-2J\beta] \\
    \lim_{T\rightarrow 0} \frac{\Gamma(\mathcal C^\prime\rightarrow\mathcal C)}{\Gamma(\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathcal C^\prime)}
        &=& 0
\end{eqnarray}
$$

At long times $t\rightarrow\infty$, the configuration will consist of large domains with different spins. Flipping a spin can happen at domain walls only, which does not change the energy $\Delta H=0$. These domain walls diffuse, which is described by [[20221026123304|random walks]].

Thus, domains shrink. When a domain consists of only a single spin, this one will flip fast, annihilating the previous domain irreversibly. This is a problem of many *annihilating random walks*.

Domain walls at distance $L$ meet after a time $t\propto L^2$. Thus, the distance increases as $L\propto\sqrt{t}$, which is the same as in $d>1$ dimensions. However, this is just a coincidence, because the process is different from the process in higher dimensions. The exact solution[^1] describes the *correlation function* $G(r, t)$ has a simple form for $T=0$ and $t\rightarrow\infty$, described by the *error function* $\erf$,

[^1]: provided by Glauber in 1963

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    L(t) &\propto& \sqrt{t} \\
    G(r, t) &=& \braket{\sigma_i\sigma_{i+1}} \\
        &=& 1 - \erf\left(\frac{r}{2}\sqrt{t}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
$$

#### iii. Ising chain with conserved dynamics
With conserved [[20231030091047|magnetization]], a *spin exchange dynamics* has to be applied.

At [[20230403104255|temperature]] $T=0$, transitions increasing the energy cannot occur, same as in the non-conserved case. Thus, any configuration without isolated spins is frozen.

For small temperatures $T>0$, coarsening reappears. If the two spins at a domain wall exchange, an isolated spin is created. The isolated spin can do a [[20221026123304|random walk]] and is able to cross the domain with a small probability, depending on the domain width $L$. Thus, domains can shift positions and diffuse with a diffusion coefficient $D_L$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    D_L &\propto& L^{-1} \\
    \Rightarrow
    D_L t &\propto& L^2 \\
    \Rightarrow
    L &\propto& \sqrt[3]{t}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Again, this behaves similar as in higher dimensions, but from a different dynamics.
